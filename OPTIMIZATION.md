# Website Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines the performance optimizations that have been implemented in the portfolio website to ensure it loads quickly and provides a smooth user experience for recruiters and visitors.

## Implemented Optimizations

1. **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading**
   - All non-critical components are lazy-loaded
   - Routes use code splitting for better initial load time
   - Suspense with fallback loading indicators

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Added `OptimizedImage` component with progressive loading
   - Lazy loading images with IntersectionObserver
   - Error handling and fallbacks

3. **Build Optimizations**
   - Minification with Terser
   - Gzip and Brotli compression
   - Bundle analysis with rollup-plugin-visualizer
   - Chunking strategy for vendor code

4. **Runtime Performance**
   - Memoization with React.memo
   - useCallback for event handlers
   - IntersectionObserver for scroll animations
   - Optimized state management

5. **Resource Loading**
   - Prefetching critical resources
   - Preconnect to external domains
   - Optimized asset loading order

## How to Use

### Development

```bash
# Install optimization dependencies
npm run optimize

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Production Build

```bash
# Create optimized production build
npm run build

# Analyze bundle size
npm run build:analyze

# Preview production build locally
npm run start
```

### Deployment Recommendations

For optimal performance when deploying to production:

1. Use a CDN for static assets
2. Enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 on your server
3. Set proper cache headers for static resources
4. Consider implementing a Service Worker for offline support

## Performance Metrics to Monitor

- First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.8s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
- Time to Interactive (TTI): < 3.8s
